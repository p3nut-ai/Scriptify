# PDF to MP3 Converter

This web application allows users to upload a PDF file, convert it to an MP3 audio file, and download or save the resulting audio. The platform uses text-to-speech (TTS) technology to read aloud the contents of the PDF and generates an MP3 file for the user.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload a PDF file from their device.
- **PDF to MP3 Conversion**: The application extracts text from the PDF and converts it into an MP3 audio file using text-to-speech technology.
- **Download Audio**: After the conversion is complete, users can download the generated MP3 file and save it for offline listening.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The website is designed with a simple and clean user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and convert PDFs.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a PDF**: The user selects a PDF file from their device or drags and drops it into the upload area.
2. **Convert to MP3**: Once the PDF is uploaded, the text is extracted and converted to speech. The audio is then processed and saved as an MP3 file.
3. **Download the MP3**: Once the conversion is complete, users can download the MP3 file and save it to their device.
